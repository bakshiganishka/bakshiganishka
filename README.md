- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @bakshiganishka
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in contributing to projects.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to code. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: via email!
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I learned how to sail last summer and I am a girl guide leader. 

## Keyboard shortcuts
Shortcuts I frequently use: 
- Command-X: Cut the selected item and copy it to the Clipboard.
- Command-C: Copy the selected item to the Clipboard. This also works for files in the Finder.
- Command-V: Paste the contents of the Clipboard into the current document or app. This also works for files in the Finder.

Shortcuts I would like to start using: 
- Control-Command-F: Use the app in full screen, if supported by the app.
- Command-T Open a new tab
- Command-A: Select All items.
- Command-K: Add a web link.
